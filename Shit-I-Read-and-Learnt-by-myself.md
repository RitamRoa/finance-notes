--> ##THIS SHOWS HOW BLOCKCHAIN MINING WORKS AND AFTER VALIDATION IT IS ADDED TO THE NETWORK

### Jargons 
Decentralized finance:
 -> using P2P financial services without requiring banking institutions.
   EG: UniSwap, MakerDAO, Aave
Supply chain management:
-> monitor supply 
  EG: IBM Food Trust, Vechain
NFT, ENtrtainment:
-> Gaming: Axie infinity, The sandbox , Decentraland --> to own in game assets, trade and monetise and to own digital NFT.. NFT marketplaces OpenSea, Rarible
Social Media:
 -> Data privacy, censorship basically solves issues around that. 
   EG: Mastodon, Steemlit, Lens Protocol
    blockchain powered content platforms: Audius, LBRY
Genesis block - first block ever mined

#### More Jargons (Bitcoin) :
 1.Ledger is a constantly changing document that changes whenever someone sends a transaction a new row of data is added. Bitcoin -> every 10mins a new block is added. 
 2.Block Hash: A uique indentifier for the block256 bits. a bitcoin block doesnt carry its own hash but the one before it for to form a chain.
 3. Public and private keys:
 Public keys are like email address for the block     public and private gives transaction details. 
 private keys are the hexadecimal format of 256 - bit number. ECDSA ( elliptical curve digital signature algorithm) secpk256k1 cryptographic SHA256 and RIPEMD160 functions\

 #### rules 
1. starts with either 1,3 or bc1
2. rest are bw 25-34 characters long.
3. 0-9, A/a - Z/z
4. visual amiguiety isnt there like Ll I 0 o .
